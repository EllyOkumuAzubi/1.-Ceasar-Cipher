# My First Ceaser Cipher project 

This is my Ceaser Cipher code which prompts the user to choose to encrypy or decrypt 

The next step will be to required the user to key in the secret key 

Display the results to the user

Ask the user if the user still want to perform any other operation ??? :
   Option 1 = Encrypt 
   Option 2 = Decrypt 
   Option 3 = Brute Force 
   Option 4 = Brute Force
   Option 5 = QUIT the program

Restrict first user input to ints 1 - 4
